## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```powershell
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd PW
```

### 2. Smart Contract Setup

```powershell
cd smart-contracts
npm install
```

Create `.env` from `.env.example`:
```powershell
cp .env.example .env
```

Fill in your `.env`:
```env
# For local development
ALCHEMY_SEPOLIA_RPC=https://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/your-key
PRIVATE_KEY=your-wallet-private-key
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=your-etherscan-api-key
```

**Deploy the contract:**

For local development:
```powershell
# Terminal 1: Start Hardhat node
npx hardhat node

# Terminal 2: Deploy
npm run deploy:local
```

For testnet (Sepolia):
```powershell
npm run deploy:sepolia
```

**Save the deployed contract address** - you'll need it for the backend!

### 3. Backend Setup

```powershell
cd ../backend
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create `.env` from `.env.example`:
```powershell
cp .env.example .env
```

Configure your backend `.env`:
```env
# Blockchain connection
RPC_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8545
CHAIN_ID=31337
PRIVATE_KEY=0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80
CONTRACT_ADDRESS=<your-deployed-contract-address>

# IPFS Storage
PINATA_JWT=your-pinata-jwt-token

# Security
JWT_SECRET=your-strong-random-secret

# CORS
FRONTEND_ORIGIN=http://localhost:8000

# Google OAuth (get from https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
```

**Setup Google OAuth:**
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
2. Create a new OAuth 2.0 Client ID
3. Add authorized redirect URI: `http://localhost:8000/auth/google/callback`
4. Copy Client ID and Client Secret to `.env`

**Create card images:**

Place card images in `backend/static/images/cards/`:
- aiml.png
- cloud.png
- web.png
- gd.png
- crpr.png
- broadcast.png
- cyber.png
- arvr.png
- app.png
- video.png

- Polygon Amoy: `80002`
- Polygon Mainnet: `137`

### Network RPC URLs
Update `RPC_URL` in backend `.env`:
- Local: `http://127.0.0.1:8545`
- Sepolia: `https://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_KEY`
- Polygon Amoy: `https://polygon-amoy.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_KEY`
- Polygon Mainnet: `https://polygon-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_KEY`

## 🧪 Testing

### Smart Contract Tests
```powershell
cd smart-contracts
npm test
```

### Backend Tests
```powershell
cd backend
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate
pytest
```

## 📝 Notes

- **Gas Payments**: Server pays gas for minting (via PRIVATE_KEY in backend .env)
- **Security**: Never commit `.env` files to git
- **Database**: SQLite file `mlsa_cards.db` created automatically on first run
- **Metadata**: All NFT metadata stored on IPFS via Pinata
- **Local Testing**: Use Hardhat's default test accounts for development

## 🔐 Security Considerations

- Store sensitive keys in `.env` files (never commit)
- Use separate wallets for development and production
- Rotate JWT secrets regularly
- Enable CORS only for trusted origins
- Validate all user inputs on backend

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**"Auth failed" errors:**
- Clear localStorage in browser DevTools
- Ensure JWT_SECRET is set in backend `.env`

**"Contract not found" errors:**
- Verify CONTRACT_ADDRESS in backend `.env`
- Ensure Hardhat node is running (for local)
- Check RPC_URL and CHAIN_ID match your network

**"Insufficient points" errors:**
- Solve more problems to earn points
- Check points balance on homepage

**Mint fails:**
- Ensure wallet is connected
- Verify PRIVATE_KEY has funds for gas
- Check RPC connection
- Confirm contract is deployed

**Google OAuth errors:**
- Verify redirect URI matches exactly: `http://localhost:8000/auth/google/callback`
- Check CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET are correct
- Ensure OAuth consent screen is configured
